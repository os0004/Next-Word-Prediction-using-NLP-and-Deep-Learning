# Next Word Prediction
This repository contains the implementation of a Next Word Prediction model using TensorFlow, Keras, and LSTM. The model is designed to predict the next word in a given sequence of words, which can be used for various natural language processing (NLP) applications.

Next word prediction is a common task in NLP where the goal is to predict the next word in a sequence of words. This project uses an LSTM-based neural network to achieve this task. The model is trained on a large corpus of text data to learn the patterns and context of the language.
